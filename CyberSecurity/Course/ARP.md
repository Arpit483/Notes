ARP stands for "Address Resolution Protocol" and is used to map dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to permanent physical machine addresses, also called media access control (MAC) addresses. ARP was designed to let these two systems interoperate by converting 32-bit IPV4 addresses to 48-bit MAC addresses. This conversion protocol lives between layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model — MAC addresses are part of layer 2, the data link layer. In contrast, IP addresses are part of layer 3, the network layer.

Functionally, ARP made it possible for companies to get a more complete picture of their device and network infrastructure at scale — something that's now critical as device use expands, and IT complexity increases. But ARP also offers another benefit: Enhanced security.
