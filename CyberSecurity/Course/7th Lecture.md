The first communication between the device is called the **first handshake** it will contain **SYN** packet (Synchronization packet ) this will contain the reason for contacting when responding it will contain **ACK by SYN** (Asynchronous packet) then again tell why contacting by **Syn** and if it contains a harmful action then it will send **RST**  (Reset).
