**Description** : The Unified Kill Chain is a framework which establishes the phases of an attack, and a means of identifying and mitigating risk to IT assets.

UKC is a framework that is used to complement other frameworks such as MITRE.

## What is a "Kill Chain"

Kill Chain” is a term used to explain the various stages of an attack


## What is "Threat Modelling"

Threat modelling is a series of steps to ultimately improve the security of system.
1. Identifying what systems and applications need to be secured and what function they serve in the environment. 
2. Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems and applications may have and how they could be potentially exploited
3. Creating a plan of action to secure these systems and applications from the vulnerabilities highlighted
4. Putting in policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from occurring again where possible (for example, implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) for an application or training employees on phishing awareness).

STRIDE ( *Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and Elevation of Privilege*  [Description](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#stride)), DREAD ( *A system used by microsoft to assess risk to computer security threats*  [Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/driversecurity/threat-modeling-for-drivers#the-dread-approach-to-threat-assessment)) and CVSS(*Common Vulnerability Scoring System* [Description](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)) are all frameworks specifically used in threat modelling

## Introducing the Unified Kill Chain

It aims to complement (**not compete** with) other cybersecurity kill chain frameworks, such as Lockheed Martin’s and MITRE’s ATT&CK.

Some large benefits of the UKC over traditional cybersecurity kill chain frameworks include the fact that it is modern and extremely detailed

## Phase: In (Initial Foothold)

1. **Reconnaissance ([MITRE Tactic TA0043](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/))**
2. **Weaponization ([MITRE Tactic TA0001](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/))**
3. **Social Engineering ([MITRE Tactic TA0001](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/))**
4. **Exploitation ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))**
5. **Persistence ([MITRE Tactic TA0003](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/))**
6. **Defence Evasion ([MITRE Tactic TA0005](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/))**
7. **Command & Control ([MITRE Tactic TA0011](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/))**
8. **Pivoting ([MITRE Tactic TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))**

## Phase: Through (Network Propagation)

This phase follows a successful foothold being established on the target network. An attacker would seek to gain additional access and privileges to systems and data to fulfil their goals. The attacker would set up a base on one of the systems to act as their pivot point and use it to gather information about the internal network.

1. **Pivoting** ([MITRE Tactic TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))
2.  **Discovery** ([MITRE Tactic TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/))
3. **Privilege Escalation** ([MITRE Tactic TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/))
4.  **Execution** ([MITRE Tactic TA0002](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/))
5.  **Credential Access** ([MITRE Tactic TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/))
6.  **Lateral Movement** ([MITRE Tactic TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/))


## Phase: Out (Action on Objectives)

This phase wraps up the journey of an adversary’s attack on an environment, where they have critical asset access and can fulfil their attack goals. These goals are usually geared toward compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad.
