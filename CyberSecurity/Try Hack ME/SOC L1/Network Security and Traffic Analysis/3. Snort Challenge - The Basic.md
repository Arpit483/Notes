# Writing IDS Rules (HTTP)

## Answer the questions below

1. Navigate to the task folder and use the given pcap file.  Write a rule to detect all TCP packets **from or to** port 80.  What is the number of detected packets you got?  Note: You must answer this question correctly before answering the rest of the questions.

Ans : 
Use the rule :  `alert tcp any any <> any 80 (msg:"OHH"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)`

and edit it in the local.rules files
```shell
sudo gedit local.rules
```

once edited run snort
```shell
snort -c local.rules -A full -l . -r mx-3.pcap 
```

To view the snort file we use 
```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473 
```

And we have our answer 
**Ans**  : 164


2. Investigate the log file.  What is the destination address of packet 63?
To view this use the command
```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473 -n 63
```
The -n parameter ensures that only packets up to 63.

**Ans** : 216.239.59.99

3. Investigate the log file.  What is the ACK number of packet 64?
```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473  -n 64
```
![[Pasted image 20250728234040.png]]

**Ans** : 0x2E6B5384

4. Investigate the log file.  What is the SEQ number of packet 62?

```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473  -n 64
```

![[Pasted image 20250728234130.png]]

**Ans** : 0x36C21E28

5. Investigate the log file.  What is the TTL of packet 65?

```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473  -n 65
```

![[Pasted image 20250728234348.png]]

**Ans:** 128

6. Investigate the log file.  What is the source IP of packet 65?

**Ans**: 145.254.160.237

7. Investigate the log file.  What is the source port of packet 65?

**Ans** : 3372




# Writing IDS Rules (FTP)

## Answer the questions below

1. Use the given pcap file.  Write a **single** rule to detect "**all TCP port 21**"  traffic in the given pcap.  What is the number of detected packets?

**Rule** : `alert tcp any any <> any 21 (msg : "Source" ; sid:1000001 ; rev:1;)`

```shell
 sudo snort -c local.rules -A full -l . -r ftp-png-gif.pcap 
```

```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753725473 
```
![[Pasted image 20250728235503.png]]

**Ans** : 307

2. Investigate the log file.  What is the FTP service name?

```shell
 strings snort.log.1753727012
```

![[Pasted image 20250729000352.png]]

**Ans**: Microsoft FTP Service

3. Deactivate/comment on the old rules. Write a rule to detect failed FTP login attempts in the given pcap.  What is the number of detected packets?

Rule : `alert tcp any any <> any 21 (msg : "Source" ; content:"530" ; sid:1000001 ; rev:1;)`

Run it 
```shell
snort -c local.rules -A full -l . -r ftp-png-gif.pcap
```

![[Pasted image 20250729001209.png]]

**Ans** : 41 


4. Write a rule to detect successful FTP logins in the given pcap. What is the number of detected packets?

Rule : `alert tcp any any <> any 21 (msg : "Source" ; content:"230" ; sid:1000001 ; rev:1;)`

Run it
![[Pasted image 20250729001453.png]]

**Ans** : 1


5. Write a rule to detect FTP login attempts with a valid username but no password entered yet. What is the number of detected packets?

Rule : `alert tcp any any <> any 21 (msg : "Source" ; content:"331" ; sid:1000001 ; rev:1;)`
![[Pasted image 20250729001724.png]]

**Ans:** 42

6. Write a rule to detect FTP login attempts with the "Administrator" username but no password entered yet. What is the number of detected packets?

Rule : `alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"FTP login attempt with 'Administrator' username"; content:"USER Administrator"; nocase; sid:1000003; rev:1;)`
![[Pasted image 20250729002030.png]]
**Ans :** 7

# Writing IDS Rules (PNG)

## Answer the questions below 

1. Write a rule to detect the PNG file in the given pcap. Investigate the logs and identify the software name embedded in the packet.

Rule : `alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"PNG file detected"; content:"|89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A|"; sid:1000004; rev:1;)`
```shell
sudo snort -r snort.log.1753729993 -X
```

![[Pasted image 20250729004910.png]]

**Ans**: Adobe ImageReady
