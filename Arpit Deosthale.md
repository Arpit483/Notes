## Security Operations Experience (Simulated & Project-Based)

#### SIEM Lab & Incident Response Simulation

- Engineered a hands-on lab environment using Splunk to simulate end-to-end SOC workflows.
    
- Monitored real-time data streams, triaged security alerts based on severity, and escalated potential incidents for investigation.
    
- Investigated simulated threats such as malware infections, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access by analyzing logs and identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
    
- Responded to incidents by executing basic mitigation actions within the lab environment to contain threats.
    
- Documented all findings, creating detailed incident reports and building custom Splunk dashboards for enhanced threat visibility.
